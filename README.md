## Overview
### Description
This app makes planning trips easy, allowing users to find all necessary information from plane ticket costs to hotels. It also allows users to look at images of places, filter locations by characteristics, and upload their own photos from traveling. The app will estimate costs, and can suggest trips with multiple destinations minimizing cost.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel/Productivity
- **Mobile:** No website, just a mobile app. Uses maps and camera.
- **Story:** Allows users to organize their traveling plans more easily. Also allows user to store their vacation/travel photos to appear on the map.
- **Market:** Anyone who is traveling, whether for vacations or for business trips, could find this app useful and time-saving. This is more aimed at trips traveling via plane.
- **Habit:** Users would use this app when they are planning a trip, or while on the trip. Users can also upload their photos from the trips so that they can see photo clusters while in map view.
- **Scope:** This app will start out with just a map view that leads to images of the location when clicked. Then it will continue to incorporate resources like plane ticket costs, hotels, restaurants, and car rentals. With sufficient resources, the app can expand to help plan trips with multiple destinations that minimizes costs.
